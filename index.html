                I am a web developer based in Atlanta with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java.
                I am a sophomore at the University of West Georgia.
                I am studying computer science and currently learning software development in Java and systems-level software development, such as network communication, file organization, and script programming.
                Since January of 2020, I worked at the University of West Georgia as a Web Developer.
                I develop internal web pages, document data interactions with servers, and perform QA on the University Website.
                I play a pivotal role in experimenting with different data analysis tools, such as Domo, to find the best tool for our use case.
                I earned two certificates from Free Code Camp, which is where I learned Web Development.
                I love solving problems with programming and challenging myself to create better software.
